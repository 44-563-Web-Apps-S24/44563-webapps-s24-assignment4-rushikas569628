    <h6 class="chubukov">CHUBUKOV.</h6> <p class="speech">of course, my darling, and... as if she won't consent!
    She's in love; egad, she's like a love-sick cat, and so on.... Shan't be
    long!</p><p class="direction">[Exit.]</p>
    
    <h6 class="lomov">LOMOV.</h6> <p class="speech">It's cold... I'm trembling all over, just as if I'd got an
    examination before me. The great thing is, I must have my mind made up.
    If I give myself time to think, to hesitate, to talk a lot, to look for
    an ideal, or for real love, then I'll never get married.... Brr!... It's
    cold! Natalya Stepanovna is an excellent housekeeper, not bad-looking,
    well-educated.... What more do I want? But I'm getting a noise in
    my ears from excitement.</p><p class="direction">[Drinks]</p> <p class="speech">it's impossible for me not to
    marry.... In the first place, I'm already 35--a critical age, so to
    speak. In the second place, I ought to lead a quiet and regular life....
    I suffer from palpitations, I'm excitable and always getting awfully
    upset.... At this very moment my lips are trembling, and there's a
    twitch in my right eyebrow.... But the very worst of all is the way
    I sleep. I no sooner get into bed and begin to go off when suddenly
    something in my left side--gives a pull, and I can feel it in my
    shoulder and head.... I jump up like a lunatic, walk about a bit, and
    lie down again, but as soon as I begin to get off to sleep there's
    another pull! And this may happen twenty times....</p>
    
    <p class="direction">[NATALYA STEPANOVNA comes in.]</p>
    
    <h6 class="Natalya">NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</h6> <p class="speech">Well, there! It's you, and papa said, "Go; there's a
    merchant come for his goods." How do you do, Ivan Vassilevitch!</p>
    
    <h6 class="lomov">LOMOV.</h6> <p class="speech">How do you do, honoured Natalya Stepanovna?</p>
    
    <h6 class="Natalya">NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</h6> <p class="speech">You must excuse my apron and négligé... we're
    shelling peas for drying. Why haven't you been here for such a long
    time? Sit down.</p><p class="direction">[They seat themselves]</p> <p class="speech">won't you have some lunch?</p>
    
    <h6 class="lomov">LOMOV.</h6> <p class="speech">No, thank you, I've had some already.</p>
